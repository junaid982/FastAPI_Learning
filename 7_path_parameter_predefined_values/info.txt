# Suppose you have a API 

# /get/product/category/{category_name}


# this is a dynamic category ,user can pass anything here in a str formate ,
# but you have limited categories in your application 

# if user passes correct catory then your application is working fine .
# but what if user passes a category which you dont have . in this case typically you write a else block 


# But in Fast API you can Predefine those categories only which need to be passed .

and also write a specific operations on it 

# Example are there in main.py
