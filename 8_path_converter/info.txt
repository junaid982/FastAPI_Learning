# Suppose you have created the API 

in which you have to pass the "file URL" example "/var/www/html/project/media/text.txt" 

this is you file opath and you have to upload into the API 

But Directly fast APi cannot take as input 

fastapi only get the data from the first / and after that the data does not match with any other URLS thats why its shows Unknown


to fix this u have to just pass the "path"

shown you in the example of main.py
